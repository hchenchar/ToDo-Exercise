# ToDo-Exercise
Description of Project: This project creates a styled ToDo list application in React.  This project is intended to demonstrate how to set state in a React app and how to refactor code in order to separate the functionality into separate components.

How to Run: Clone this repository to your local machine, then open a command line on your computer terminal and run the command "cd path-to-project-root (the directory where the cloned repository is located on your local machine). From there, run "npm install http-server" and once complete, run "http-server -c-1". Lastly, open your web browser and load: http://127.0.0.1:8080. Once the ToDo page loads, you can click on each todo item to clear it off of the list.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Looking ahead, I would like to add in additional functionality that allows the user to delete todo items once they have been completed.
